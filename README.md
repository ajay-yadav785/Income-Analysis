Sales-Analysis Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for a data-driven project focused on enhancing customer experience and improving sales performance. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the identification of key insights related to delayed payments and profit sources.
Key Activities
1.	Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Ensured dataset accuracy and consistency for reliable analysis using various data cleaning techniques (e.g., handling missing values, outlier removal, data transformation).
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Utilized libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy for comprehensive dataset exploration, providing valuable insights into customer behaviors, product performance, and sales trends.
3.	Income Sales Analysis
Analyzed sales data in relation to customer income groups, identifying patterns and insights. Focus was placed on understanding which income groups were contributing the most to sales and how income levels correlate with purchase behavior.
4.	Delayed Payments Analysis
Identified customers with delayed payments and analyzed the correlation between payment delays and other factors (e.g., region, product category, or customer type). This helps in determining areas to improve cash flow management.
5.	Customer Experience Improvement
Identified key customer segments (across states, occupation, gender, and age groups) to target with personalized offerings, helping to improve customer satisfaction and retention.
6.	Sales Improvement and Profit Source Identification
Analyzed sales data to identify the most profitable product categories and specific products. This helps in making informed inventory planning decisions and optimizing product offerings to increase profitability.
